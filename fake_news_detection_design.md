## Data Flow Architecture

```
News Sources → Preprocessing → Content Classification → Agent Routing
                                                            ↓
Multi-Agent Analysis ← Tool Integration ← External Sources
         ↓
Evidence Aggregation → Decision Making → Output Generation
         ↓                    ↓              ↓
    Monitoring ←        Alerting ←     Reporting
         ↓                    ↓              ↓
    Feedback Loop ←    Human Review ← Expert Validation
```
